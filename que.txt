1. Simulate an airline seat reservation system using a sparse matrix where only selected 
seats are booked, and efficiently display booked vs. unbooked seats. (Hint: Use 2D 
sparse representation and display only non-zero entries.)
2. Build a student attendance tracker where attendance records for multiple days are 
stored in a sparse matrix. Display only the days and students with absences. (Hint: Treat 
absences as non-zero values in a sparse structure.)
3. Develop a movie collection search tool where movie names can be searched using both 
linear and binary search. Compare search time on sorted vs. unsorted lists. (Hint: 
Maintain two lists: unsorted for linear search, sorted for binary.)
4. Create a hotel room management system where room prices can be sorted using 
insertion, bubble and selection sort. Compare the efficiency of each for large room lists.
(Hint: Use same data for all sorting methods and record time.)
5. Create a hotel room management system where room prices can be sorted using quick 
sort. Compare the efficiency of each for large room lists. (Hint: Use same data for all 
sorting methods and record time.)
6. Implement an expression validator to check for balanced parentheses using a stack. 
Display valid or invalid based on proper symbol matching. (Hint: Push opening brackets; 
pop when matching closing bracket appears.)
7. Design a bus ticket counter simulation using a circular queue where passengers board 
and exit efficiently. (Hint: Use front and rear logic to manage flow.)
8. Simulate a music playlist using a doubly linked list where users can play next, previous, 
add, or delete songs. (Hint: Use bidirectional navigation + insert/delete operations.)
9. Implement a hospital patient record system where records are stored in a BST. Allow 
insertion, deletion, and searching based on patient ID. (Hint: Use integer IDs as keys in 
BST.)
10. Create a social network friend suggestion system using graphs where each user is a 
node. Suggest friends using BFS-based shortest paths. (Hint: Suggest nodes at level-2 
distance.)
Enter number of users: 5
Friend connections (edges):
1 2
1 3
2 4
3 5
Suggest friends for user: 1
11. Develop a product lookup system using hashing where items are stored by SKU codes. 
Handle collisions using linear probing. (Hint: Use open addressing to resolve collisions.)
Enter number of products: 5
SKUs: 101, 205, 330, 412, 101 (duplicate to test collision)
Search SKU: 330
12. Simulate a book-arranging robot that sorts books by their IDs using merge sort.
13. Build a browser history manager using two stacks for back and forward navigation.
(Hint: Push/Pop operations simulate real browser behavior.)
14. Develop an ambulance dispatch system using a max priority queue to serve highest 
priority cases first. (Hint: Priority determines removal order.)
15. Create a book-return bin simulator where returned books are stacked and then 
processed in LIFO order. (Hint: Simple stack push/pop.)
16. Implement a railway parcel management system where parcels are stored in hash 
tables using their tracking numbers. (Hint: Use modulo hashing + chaining.)
17. Simulate a food delivery route planner using graphs to show all delivery paths using 
DFS. (Hint: Treat restaurants and deliveries as nodes.)
18. Simulate a food delivery route planner using graphs to show the shortest path 
estimations using BFS. (Hint: Treat restaurants and deliveries as nodes.)
19. Build a bank transaction recorder using a queue to process transactions in order. (Hint: 
FIFO processing of deposits/withdrawals.)
Transactions:
Deposit 500
Withdraw 200
Deposit 1000
Withdraw 300
20. Develop a railway timetable sorting tool where arrival times are sorted using insertion 
sort and selection sort. Compare their performance. (Hint: Time-based sorting 
comparison.)
21. Implement a polynomial calculator using linked lists where polynomials can be created, 
added, and simplified. (Hint: Each node contains coefficient and power.)
22. Simulate a campus navigation system using weighted graphs where buildings are nodes; 
display shortest path using BFS (for unweighted). (Use adjacency list for efficiency.)
Buildings:
Library, Canteen, Lab, Admin, Hostel
Connections:
Library–Lab
Lab–Hostel
Canteen–Library
Admin–Hostel
Find path: Canteen → Hostel
23. Build a shipment tracking queue where parcels enter the system and are processed in 
the order they arrive using a linear queue. (Hint: Simple FIFO process.)
Enter parcels: P100, P102, P105, P110, etc.
